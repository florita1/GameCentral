<p>Blackjack is a popular American casino game, now found throughout the world. <br>
It is a banking game in which the aim of the player is to achieve a hand whose points total nearer to 21 than the banker's hand, but without exceeding 21. <br>
In Nevada casinos the game is generally known 21 rather than Blackjack, and the holding of an ace with a 10-point card is called a "natural".<br>
Confusingly, the name Black Jack is used in Britain for an entirely different card game which is essentially the same as Crazy Eights.<br>
The following outline explains the basic rules of standard blackjack (21), along with the house rules most commonly featured in casinos.<br> 
Players should bear in mind, though, that blackjack rules vary from casino to casino, and check for local variations before playing.<br>
